## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1) AI‑Powered Task Manager

A side‑project that lets users add tasks in natural language (e.g., “remind me to send the report tomorrow”).

* **What it does:** Parses intent, categorizes tasks, infers due dates/priority, and summarizes progress.
* **How it works:** Python **FastAPI** backend, React/TS frontend, PostgreSQL. Integrates **Gemini** for NLP and a local **semantic reconciliation** layer (SentenceTransformers + fuzzy match) to reduce category drift while still allowing organic categories.
* **Why it’s interesting:** It balances AI flexibility with determinism—separating intent parsing, enrichment, and summarization into clear stages.
* **Code:** [github.com/prafulnair/AI_ToDo_App](https://github.com/prafulnair/AI_ToDo_App)

### 2) Ford–Fulkerson Network Flow Lab (Live)

A research‑style playground to run and compare **max‑flow** strategies with clear residual‑graph visuals.

* **What it does:** Generates graphs, runs Ford–Fulkerson with multiple augmenting‑path heuristics, and compares max flow, path counts, and path lengths with residual snapshots.
* **What changed recently:** Refactored into a modular Python package with dataclasses for graph/residual snapshots; consolidated strategies (Shortest Augmenting Path, DFS‑like, Max Capacity, Random) into a clean algorithms module; added reproducible graph generation (seeded + CSV persistence) and **pytest** fixtures/regression tests.
* **Why it’s useful:** Run headless experiments or explore interactively; visualize residual networks and flow evolution.
* **Live:** 👉 [Streamlit demo](https://praful-ford-fulkerson-network-flow.streamlit.app/)

### 3) GCP ETL Pipeline

* End‑to‑end ingestion and transformation on **GCP** (Cloud Functions, Storage, BigQuery).
* Emphasis on schema design, idempotency, and cost awareness.
